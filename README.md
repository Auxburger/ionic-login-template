# Ionic Angular Login Template

## 👩🏽‍💻 Welcome fellows! 👨🏽‍💻

I recently thought about sharing some knowledge with others, therefore I started working on my first template repository.

This template makes your life easier if a login for your Ionic App is needed. Furthermore, it is build with Angular.

## Steps to Integrate

1. In the folder `src/environment` there are the files `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`. Please insert the configuration for your specific Project (everything but the production variable!). The `*.prod.ts` file is obviously the configuration for the production mode.
2. Adapt the AuthenticationService, so that it uses your authentication methods to log in and log out.

Great Thanks and stay healthy 😊
